# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description

The purpose of this project was to refactor existing code in order to make it more accessible. The Horiseon site was almost fully functioning but lacking many accessiblity tools. By completing the project I was able to learn about semantic html, accessiblity tags and attributes, and the Scout Rule.
